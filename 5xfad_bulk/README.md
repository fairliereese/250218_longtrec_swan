## SwanGraph creation / update

This SwanGraph I don't have the individual components to create, but nevertheless I include the code I used to update the SwanGraph to the current Swan version and to run the isoform switching code in `reformat_swan_graph.ipynb` file.

## Plotting from SwanGraph

Code to make the plots from the presentation yourself now is in `swan.ipynb`.
